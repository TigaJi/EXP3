# EXP3 FOR DYNAMIC ASSET ALLOCATION
EXP3 stands for Exponential-weight algorithm for Exploration and Exploitation, and it is a type of multi-arm bandits algorithm. 

In this repo, we use the bandits nature for dynamic asset allocation among a given portfolio. By invest the money porportionally to the weights of each arm, in our case a stock, fund or commity, we hope it could yield a higher and more stable long-term reward. 

See exp3.py for the source code implementing the algorithm, and exp3_test.ipynb for the experienment and results.
